# CS 18000 Team Project - Social Media Platform

---

## Phase 1

##### Due: November 1, 2024

We will be doing a News Feed, which features, allows the user to post, display all friends posts in a feed, Enable comment on posts and upvote, downvote and hide post from feed.

For our database will be using an txt file to store posts for feed, along with managing users and comments.

GUI: TBD

The first phase of the project consists of building the entire database side of the project including interfaces and test cases. Questions such as: What are we storing? How are we accessing it? What are we calculating? Project 3 was an example of a database. HW10 covers techniques on how to make the database thread safe. Remember the database will only be interacting with a single server; however, that server will be interacting with multiple clients simultaneously. 

### Infrastructure of the server and database

TBD
